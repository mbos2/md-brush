If you'd like to contribute to this project by either fixing a bug or adding new feature, this is how you do it: 

- If issue for what you want to add exists, create a branch named `contribution/issueID`, write your code and make PR for review
- If issue for what you want to add does not exist, create an issue, describe what you'd like to add and then start coding under a branch named `contribution/issueID`

Happy coding :)
