# The idea

Flashcoll is a platform for sharing github projects with social networks and connecting with other developers in the process.
Idea is to share your project across social networks to find collaborators for your project.

The process of sharing your project with Flashcoll is next:

#### Github

- Create public github repository
- Describe your project in more detail in README.md file
- Add short description in repo's About section (this is just optional but is recommended)

#### Flashcoll

- Log in or Sign up with your github account
- Add your social network links by clicking on `My networks` button so people know where they can contact you
- Add your project to Flashcoll by clicking on `New project` button
- Start sharing with social network buttons

WIth social network buttons you can share your project or even your whole profile

# Why flashcoll?

The idea is to find people you can collaborate with much faster.
By connecting with other developers on social networks you can discuss project idea, or ideas, more easily.
But, even if you don't collaborate at first, you can still consider them a friend or a collegue and work on project ideas you will both be interested in.
